  - question: "How much is it?"
    answer: >-
        We charge a simple hourly rate of Â£12.95 per hour of cleaning, with your cleaner receiving well over the minimum wage. Unlike most other cleaning companies, we do not have any minimum number of bookings or contract. You are free to pause or cancel your cleaning whenever you wish. Please note our minimum visit length is 2 hours.
  - question: "How do I pay?"
    answer: >-
        We have a simple online payment system. Once your clean is confirmed, we'll email you a link to set up your acccount and enter card details. We'll then process an automated payment the day after every clean. An invoice and receipt will be emailed to you at the same time. All cleans are run through our custom app. Once at the property, your cleaner will start and finish the job, and, assuming that the scheduled time and GPS coordinates are correct, the job will be queued for payment.
  - question: "How does it work?"
    answer: >-
        Get in touch either by giving us a call or via the forms on our Location Pages above. A local manager will get straight back to you. Simply let us know your requirements, arrange access (we are fully insured to hold keys obviously) and set a date, time and frequency for your clean (fortnightly/weekly/bi-weekly etc). We'll then send you a confirmation email and you're good to go. We are extremely flexible so any changes either to your cleaning time or routine is no trouble at all.
  - question: "What about access?"
    answer: >-
        On your first visit, you may like to meet your cleaner, who will then be your allocated cleaner moving forward. At that point you can hand over a spare key (we are of course insured to hold keys), or leave a key in a secure place, which can be posted back through your letterbox upon completion.
  - question: "Do you do ironing?"
    answer: >-
        Absolutely! Many customers like to tag on a bit of time at the end of their clean - just let us know and we'll arrange it for you.
  - question: "What cleaning products do I need?"
    answer: >-
        Although our cleaners carry spare cleaning products, over the years we've found people prefer to use their own. The list of what you'll need is pretty generic really, but some good cloths and a working vaccum are a must. If you can aim to have the majority of these products that's be great, and we'll remind you again of what's needed in your confirmation email.<ul><li>Bathroom cleaner</li><li> Bin bags</li><li>Duster</li><li>Floor cleaner</li><li>Glass cleaner</li><li>Kitchen cleaner</li><li>Limescale remover</li><li>Microfiber cloths (washed inbetween visits)</li><li>Rubber gloves</li><li>Sponges</li><li>Toilet cleaner</li><li>Vacuum bags (if required)</li><li>Washing-up liquid</li></ul>
  - question: "How do you vet your cleaners?"
    answer: >-
        As a company, we are only as good as the cleaners with whom we work, and are therefore extremely selective about who we take on. All applicants must have a proven track record in domestic cleaning, references, in addition to undertaking document checks. Only applicants who are able to pass a DBS check are accepted.
