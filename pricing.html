      <p>Like everything else at Cleanily, our pricing structure and way of charging is incredibly flexible. We charge by the hour (or part thereof to the nearest 15 minutes). All cleans are timed and GPS tracked to give you the most cost effective pricing possible.</p>

       <p> You do not need a quote. We’re not refitting your kitchen, we’re just cleaning it. The likelihood is, you’ll have a good idea how long it takes to clean your home anyway, and if not, we can accurately estimate over the phone in less than a minute. Then, just multiply this amount of time by the prevailing rate in your location, and there’s your quote!</p>

       <p> If a little more time is required and you’ve ok with that, then fine, similarly, if a little less is required, then no problem. Since we allocate the same experienced cleaner each visit, they will know by the end of the first clean.</p>
<p>
        You are not tied in to any minimum number of cleans and there and you’re free to pause (via your online portal) or cancel whenever you wish. If you've got around 4 minute's to spare, check out the video below on how the domestic cleaning industry prices cleaning. The variation and inflexibility is exactly what inspired us to price the way we do.
